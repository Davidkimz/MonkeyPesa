QUESTIONS:
This is going to be like a software that a company might need to run 
its day to day management.

I see we are looking and mainly marketting and sales.
Am not sure if we should restrict to that.


So for a campany who buys the software lets assume its for marketing 
and sales

-How many users of the system do we have 
-Who logs in and out
-What kind of activities do each of the users do with the system for the case 
of marketting and sales
